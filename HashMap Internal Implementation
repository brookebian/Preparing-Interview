How HashMap Work?

HashMap works as a table(array of Entry(key-value) or LinkedList<Entry>). 

hash(key.hashCode()) to form a hashcode for key and use that hash to find the index inside of the table

if the index already has some Entry && key duplicated ---> replace the value

if the index already has some Entry && not key duplicated ---> put Entry in next of previous one (LinkedList)
